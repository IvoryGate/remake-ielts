Good afternoon. Dream time travel.

How can I help you?

Oh, hello. I am interested in the holidays you offer along the coast near here.

Yes,we operate several tours up the coast, where in particular did you want to go?

Well, i like the sound of the holiday that mentioned whales.

Was  it ,emmm, whale watching

oh that our whale watch  experience

it’s very popular, and it is based in a lovely little town with nice beaches

oh right, and how long does it last

it is two days, and that includes four hours’ travel time each way form here

good i don’t want to be away any longer than that

so is that by coach?

actually, it is by minibus.

we like to keep those tours small and personal, so we don’t take a whole coachload of people

in fact we only take up to 15 people on this tour,although we do run it with just 12 or 13

oh right

so did you run these tours often

well it depends on the time of the year

of course in peak times like the summer holidays we do them every weekend, but at the moment, it is usually once a month at most 

and when is the next one going 

emmm let me see

there is one in three weeks’ time which is apirl the 18,and then we don’t have another one until june second

all right and the apirl is a good time to go?

pretty good,though the really good time is later in the year 

i have to though that the whale sighting is only one of the many things offered

really?

yes

the hotel itself where you stay is great facilities

it is called the pallisades

the paris what?

no it is actually the Pallisades,p-a-double l-i-s-a-d-e-s

it is right on the main beach there

oh i see

all of the rooms have nice views, and food is really good there too

oh right

and what about the other things?

you know that are included in the price

oh there are lots of things

if you don’t want do the whale watch cruise,your guide will take anyone who is interested either on a bushwalk, through the national park near the hotel,and there’s no extra charge for that,or on a fishing trip

that is an extra 12 dollars i think

and there’s also a reptile park in town, that costs small more or less the same.

no i think i’d prefer whales to snakes 

yes and if you just want to relax, you are free to sit by the hotel pool or go down the beach

oh,they also have tennis courts at the hotel, but you have to pay for those by the hour.

but there are table tennis tables downstairs and there are part of the accomodation package.  

just speak to your guide

wow that sounds good

so how mush is the basic tour price

at this time of the year, it’s usually around 300 dollars. but let me check

oh,it’s actually 280 dollars

and the next tour, are there any places on that one

how many people is it for?

there are two of us

yes that should be fine

can i just mention that we require all bookings should be made at least 14 days before you travel to avoid cancellations of tours.

And if you cancel within 7 days of departure, you will have to pay 15% of your total booking.

OK

And you also need to pay a 20% deposite at the time of booking.

Can I pay that by credit card?

yes you can

All right, what i will do is i’ll talk to my partner get back to you

fine

so i’ll make a provisional booking shall i

two for the whale watch experience

let me issue you with a customer reference number for when you call back

do you have a pen

yes

ok it’s 39745T

that’s t for tango

when you call back ask to speak to the tour manager, that’s me, tracy	

fine i will
