Good afternoon. Dream time travel.

How can I help you?

Oh, hello. I am interested in the holidays you offer along the coast near here.

Yes,we operate several tours up the coast, where in particular did you want to go?

Well, i like the sound of the holiday that mentioned whales.

Was  it ,emmm, whale watching

oh that our whale watch  experience

it’s very popular, and it is based in a lovely little town with nice beaches

oh right, and how long does it last

it is two days, and that includes four hours’ travel time each way form here

good i don’t want to be away any longer than that

so is that by coach?

actually, it is by minibus.

we like to keep those tours small and personal, so we don’t take a whole coachload of people

in fact we only take up to 15 people on this tour,although we do run it with just 12 or 13

oh right

so did you run these tours often

well it depends on the time of the year

of course in peak times like the summer holidays we do them every weekend, but at the moment, it is usually once a month at most 

and when is the next one going 

emmm let me see

there is one in three weeks’ time which is apirl the 18,and then we don’t have another one until june second

all right and the apirl is a good time to go?

pretty good,though the really good time is later in the year 

i have to though that the whale sighting is only one of the many things offered

really?

yes

the hotel itself where you stay is great facilities

it is called the pallisades

the paris what?

no it is actually the Pallisades,p-a-double l-i-s-a-d-e-s

it is right on the main beach there

oh i see

all of the rooms have nice views, and food is really good there too

oh right

and what about the other things?

you know that are included in the price

oh there are lots of things

if you don’t want do the whale watch cruise,your guide will take anyone who is interested either on a bushwalk, through the national park near the hotel,and there’s no extra charge for that,or on a fishing trip

that is an extra 12 dollars i think

and there’s also a reptile park in town, that costs small more or less the same.

no i think i’d prefer whales to snakes 

yes and if you just want to relax, you are free to sit by the hotel pool or go down the beach

oh,they also have tennis courts at the hotel, but you have to pay for those by the hour.

but there are table tennis tables downstairs and there are part of the accomodation package.  

just speak to your guide

wow that sounds good

so how mush is the basic tour price

at this time of the year, it’s usually around 300 dollars. but let me check

oh,it’s actually 280 dollars

and the next tour, are there any places on that one

how many people is it for?

there are two of us

yes that should be fine

can i just mention that we require all bookings should be made at least 14 days before you travel to avoid cancellations of tours.

And if you cancel within 7 days of departure, you will have to pay 15% of your total booking.

OK

And you also need to pay a 20% deposite at the time of booking.

Can I pay that by credit card?

yes you can

All right, what i will do is i’ll talk to my partner get back to you

fine

so i’ll make a provisional booking shall i

two for the whale watch experience

let me issue you with a customer reference number for when you call back

do you have a pen

yes

ok it’s 39745T

that’s t for tango

when you call back ask to speak to the tour manager, that’s me, tracy	

fine i will

hello and welcome to today’s buyer beware programme, where we give you some tips on how to spend your money wisely.

no in today show we are looking a bed for childern and babies

let’s start by looking at baby cots that’s for children of up to 3 years old

we tested three different cots all in the budget price range and as usual, we will feature the good points, the problems and our verdict

the first cot we looked at was by baby safe ,and it had several good points to recommend it.

our testers like the fact that it have four wheels, so it was easy to move around.

the only slight problem with this cot was that it has no brakes, but they didn’t think that mattered too much.

at first,they were a bit concerned about the side bar, because they felt babies could trap their fingers in it. but our tester felt this was unlikely to happened. so they have given this one a verdict of ‘satisfactory’

 The next cot was by Choice Cots, and this time our testers were pleased to find a cot which is simple to put together - unlike others we looked at.

On the minus side, our testers did not like the fact that the side cot did not drop down,making it difficult to put up newborn babies.

however, the real problem with this cot was the space between the bars,our testers found they were too wide and a baby could easily trap his head.

we felt this was a real safety hazard, so we’ve labelled this one dangerous, i’m afriad

and finally better news for the mothers’ choice cot

this cot was slightly different in that, although the side bar didn’t drop down the base could be rised or lowered into two different positions making it safe as well as convenient.

the negative from this one was quiet miner, the only leagal everyone has reflected that it has no wheel and the only other probem one was find, the picture on it was simplely stuck on. so it could easy become detached 

The makers have now promised to discontinue this practice.

and this cot will be safe in anyway, we have made make the mother choice our best buy.

 Congradulations! Mother’s choice

So what features should you look for in a baby’s cot

well obviously safety is the very important fact as well as comfort and convenience

we recommend that if you are buying a cot, do make sure that any metal present is not rusted or bent in any way.

you should ensure your cot has only rounded or smooth edging without any sharp edges, this is especially important for wooden cots

excuse me, i was told to come here for advice about management deploma courses 

you’ve certainly come to the right place

hi my name is monica

nice to meet you

my name is andrew andrew harris

so andrew, have you seen our deploma course prospectus yet

yes i’ve already looked at it.

in fact, i thought the information on course content was really useful, but i’m afraid that i’m a bit confused by all the different ways you can do the course, full-time intensive, part-time and so on.

well let’s see if i can help

i think each course type has its advantages and disadvantages,so it really depends on you. your own study habits, and your financial circumstances of cause.

are you working at the moment

yes

i’ve been working in the administration section of local hosiptal for the last three years.

and before that i worked in the office of a computer engineering campany for 2 years

so i’ve got about 5 years of relevant working experience

and  what i’am hoping to focus on is personnel management

i see

and are you plan to leave your current job to study, or are you just thinking about just taking a year off

i want to know what my options are really

i don’t want to quit my job anything, and my employers are keen for me to get some more qualifications, but obviously, it would be better if i can do a course without taking too much time away from work  

right, so you don’t want to do the full-time course then 

no no really

it is also a question of finances

you see my office have agreed to pay the cost of the course itself, but i would have to take unpaid leave if i want to study full-time and, well, i don’t think i could afford to support myself with no salary for a whole year.

ok

well you have two other posibilities, you could ethier do the part-time course that will be over two years and you wouldn’t have to take any time off work,  or you could do what we call a ‘modular’ course.

you can do that in18 months if you wanted or longer, it is quite flexible and it would be up to you.

Mmmm

so what does the part-time course involve?

for that you would join an evening class, and have a lecture twice a week

then you would have to attend a seminar or discussion workshop one weekend a month

what kind of coursework would i have to do

well it’s a mixture

you’d be expected to write an essay each month, which counts towards your final assessment.

you have a case to do by the end of the course, which might involve doing a survey or something like that, and also you need to hand in a short report every four weeks.

so that’s quite a lot work then, on top of working every day

it sounds like a lot of studing, and really tiring

yeah, you certainly wouldn’t have much free time.

what about the  modular course?

what would i have to do for that.

that’s where you get the oppotunity to study full-time for short periods

that way cover a lot of course work and attend seminars during the day.

and each modular lasts for one term, say, about 12 weeks at a time.
